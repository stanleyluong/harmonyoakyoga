              <p>
                Creating a safe space means more than just physical safety‚Äîit&apos;s about fostering an 
                environment where you feel emotionally secure, respected, and free to be authentically yourself.
              </p>
              <p>
                We understand that many people come to yoga carrying stress, trauma, or simply the weight 
                of daily life. Our approach honors this reality by creating predictable, gentle experiences 
                that allow you to feel grounded and supported throughout your practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                This commitment extends to our language, our touch policies, our music choices, and even 
                the way we arrange our space. Every detail is considered through the lens of safety, 
                comfort, and respect for your individual needs and boundaries.
